# DC Damage
Control applying and handling damage to entities. Full readme in progress.

## Dependencies
None

## Installation
1. Install any listed dependencies. See an individual dependency's readme for specific instructions.
1. Download and unzip the [latest release](../../releases).
1. Place the *dc_damage* folder into your *data/scripts* folder.
1. Add ```#include data/scripts/dc_damage/main.c``` into any other script you would like to add this library’s functionality to.
1. Open *config.h* to modify default values used in the library.

## Use Cases

#### Function List

##### dc_damage_check_ko()
Find out if damage force will reduce entity's hitpoints to 0 or below when applied. Returns true (1) if damage will reduce entity's health to 0 or below, false (0) otherwise. Takes into account the final force after engine calculates attack/defense ratios.

```c
int ko = dc_damage_check_ko();
```

##### dc_damage_find_non_lethal_force()
Find and return the maximum non-lethal force from current damage force member value, after all damage ratios are calculated. For example, if the last value set to damage force member is 10, this function will return 9. If the target entity has a defense of 0.5 against the attack (eaning damage taken is normally 5), then return value would be 4.

This function is useful due to openborscript's ```damageentity()``` lacking a non-lethal option.

```c
int force = dc_damage_find_non_lethal_force();
```

##### dc_damage_get_final_force()
Find out how much hitpoint damage entity will take (i.e. after engine calculates offense/defense ratios) when damage is applied. Sends entity (defender), other (attacker), and attack members to native ```calculatedamage()``` function and returns the result.

For example, if you set up the damage members to apply a force of 80 with attack type 1, and the defender's attack type 1 defense is 0.5, ```dc_damage_get_final_force()``` will return 40.

```c
int final_force = dc_damage_get_final_force();
```
